Annotating a genome is a little hard for one who have not done these research.  
First you may need to know your species and find enough protein data by website. If you can have some RNA-seq data, it will be better for your research. Then you may try lots of software to find a better thing which can let your number of gene suitable for this species.  
This process looks easy for you, but I hide lots of details that will make your genome annotation difficult. If you have any question, you can submit it by Github. I also will supply this project in the future.
